This is a handy little utility for producing
mathjax-supported html from markdown.
I use it for writing summaries of lectures.

Installation: clone this repo.
You can also add it into your $PATH or just make an
alias overview="bash path/to/makeOverview.bash".

Usage:

bash /path/to/makeOverview.bash <your md file> [-o,--outfile your-file.html]

Hat tip to https://argbash.io. This project uses argbash-utilities
to generate its command line options and help message.


enjoy!
